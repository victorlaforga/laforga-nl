            <p>
              MagLashic came to us with an existing Shopify Store. They were
              already selling very good and wanted to scale up with us. Due to the
              limitations of the theme, they have made special requests with us
              such as a 100% custom shopping cart, a custom FAQ section, Add to
              cart buttons in specific places & optimizing the speed of the
              website. These are some examples of functions & features that we
              have applied to increase conversion.
